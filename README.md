# About the Boston Drupal Meetup Group

This group is for anyone in the Boston or greater Massachusetts area who has an interest in Drupal. Our goal is to grow and maintain a positive and supportive Drupal environment. Sharing knowledge and experiences, promoting new ideas and opportunities, fostering communication and community.

The group holds monthly meetings in various locations around Boston. Each meeting we share Drupal help, tips, skills, events and jobs. We connect and communicate as a community at https://groups.drupal.org/boston. As well as, our IRC channel #drupal-boston on Freenode.

We welcome people of all background, skills, abilities and experiences. From professionals to hobbyists, developers to product managers, Drupal novices to master Drupalistas. The only requirements are that you have an interest in Drupal and live or work in the greater Boston area.
