## About this Branch

This branch holds the presentation for the July 2016 meetup.

### Topics

The lightning talk topics for this month were:

*Summer Blockbusters: Working with blocks in Drupal*

When you need reusable pieces of content, that do not require their own pages, most likely you turn to blocks. This month we are looking for lightning talks centered around the Drupal block system. Possible questions and topics we are looking to cover:

- How do you decide when content needs to be a block? What considerations do you make?
- How do you implement the rules that state where a block should go and when it should be displayed?
- How do you use the context module to place blocks?
- What caveat and gotchas have you run into when styling blocks?
- Blocks are entities now?!? How have blocks changed in Drupal 8?
- How do you create your own block types?
- How do you output a view as a block?
- What is the difference between blocks and beans?

# About the Boston Drupal Meetup Group

This group is for anyone in the Boston or greater Massachusetts area who has an interest in Drupal. Our goal is to grow and maintain a positive and supportive Drupal environment. Sharing knowledge and experiences, promoting new ideas and opportunities, fostering communication and community.

The group holds monthly meetings in various locations around Boston. Each meeting we share Drupal help, tips, skills, events and jobs. We connect and communicate as a community at https://groups.drupal.org/boston. As well as, our IRC channel #drupal-boston on Freenode.

We welcome people of all background, skills, abilities and experiences. From professionals to hobbyists, developers to product managers, Drupal novices to master Drupalistas. The only requirements are that you have an interest in Drupal and live or work in the greater Boston area.
